My Bachelor's studies actually started at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad in September 2006. After four years, I forcefully quit education in 2010 because of some severe personal problems, and inevitably after that, as a young person, I went for the completion of my military service.

<br /><br />

After finishing the mandatory service, I tried to pursue my Bachelor's studies at Ferdowsi again, though the ruling committee did not allow me to get back. Therefore, I transferred my passed courses &mdash; 44 out of 139 credits &mdash; to Payame Noor University (a distance-education-based system) in 2013, and eventually finished my Bachelor in 2015.
